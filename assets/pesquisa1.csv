While developing the album in MagRecOne, the band had a newfound sense of creative freedom that broke away from their routine with the band's longtime producer and engineer Steve Fisk, with the album instead involving him as an instrumentalist. The album title came from a free association writing session held by Trosper, originally being the phrase ""leaves turn inside me""; he was also ""doing dream journals to work out ideas for lyrics so the whole album has dreamish gnostic quasi-religious themes throughout it"".",USA,Kill Rock Stars

This was the final installment in a five-album run that marked the group as one of the most unique acts to emerge from Egypt at the time. Al Massrieen developed a distinctly modern sound shaped by funk, disco, and pop, written in Arabic lyrics and rooted in Egyptian musical tradition but with a twist.
The group was founded in the late 1970s by Hany Shenouda, a prolific composer and producer. He assembled a collective of musicians to form Al Massrieen, which included talents such as Eman Younis, Mona Aziz, Tahseen Yalmaz, Mamdouh Qassem, and others. Shenouda wrote and arranged most of the band's music, and his vision guided the group throughout its career.

""We started jamming with Clifford on the guitar, his brother Gerard on the bass and Georges on the guitar. We chipped in with song ideas, with the group contributing arrangements and refining things until we were satisfied. The band had a natural sound, which stemmed from the chemistry we had.

Shortly before the release of his second album, Embrya , in early 1997, he was asked by MTV Unplugged to do a session based on the live talent he had demonstrated during his tour following his debut. The performance proved to be a wonderful surprise and truly confirmed Maxwell's talent.

At the time Lewis' quintet consisted of Judd Watkins with his strong baritone voice; alto saxophonist Bobby Greene; saxophonist/flutist Stan Strickland, formerly with the sextet Brute Force; and drummer Jimmy Hopps, a veteran of the Roland Kirk and Charles Tolliver groups. 
Shortly after the festival, the quintet played six nights at Oslo’s Club 7, then considered the cutting edge on the Norwegian scene.

Everything Lewis knew about music up to that point is in this record, from gospel to Baltimore R&B to progressive rock to Jimmy Smith to the compositions of Russell and Schuller. 
The Club 7 recordings aptly demonstrate the two sides of the Webster Lewis Quintet in 1971. The instrumental tracks are flowing post-bop improvisations with plenty of space for the organ and the two horns. The mood shifts from a churchy organ  to straightahead blowing to an excursion into free jazz.

A masterpiece of a grime auteur in the making, the album captured in sharp focus the emotions of a boy on a rough council estate.

Frank Floyd’s vocals are almost ghostly and glide across the track surrounded by instrumentation that’s intense and textured. The title track “Turn this Mutha Out” is a hard hitting dancefloor classic and you can clearly hear the influence of producer Dave Matthews, who worked closely with James Brown for many years. The record takes a romantic turn with “Moon Hymn,” a track that postures less to the dance floor and leans into smooth jazz territory.

Droog flexes his narrative muscles both comically (“My Girl Is A Boy”) and dramatically (“G.K.A.C”) on this new album. For instance, the single “You Can Do It (Give Up)” is an ode to practicality over fantasy told in three vignettes. Co-produced by Edan, and Y.O.D. himself “You Can Do It (Give Up)” is almost the bizarro version of Biz Markie’s “Vapors.” The reclusive Edan also produces and appears on the raucous posse cut “Help” with Ratking frontman Wiki. The three MC’s trade bars over an explosive beat that is as inspired psychedelic rock as it is hip-hop.

Droog also shares mic duties with fellow rap iconoclasts Danny Brown (“Grandma Hips”) and Heems (“Bangladesh”) and, for good measure, comedian Anthony Jeselnik lends his dark humor to skits between songs. Besides the return of Droog’s go-to production partner El RTNC, PACKS also features production from platinum producers ID Labs (Wiz Khalifa, Mac Miller) and 88 Keys (Watch The Throne, Action Bronson, Mos Def). The sum of it all is an album that stands out from the predictable offerings of mainstream rappers today. PACKS is a project for fans of hip-hop’s fundamentals and those who are interested in the progress of the artform.

Songs like ‘Unbreak My Love’ and ‘Rain Water Promise’ come from that place of dealing with the end. A story of lovers parting and making sense of the battling feelings of resentment and longing. As well as the existential aspect of having to end of a relationship. All while with dealing long-time depression, songs like lead single “Quantum Suicide” and “Shed That Fear” exhibit the importance of choosing to live and that getting out of pits of despair requires tremendous amounts of effort and intention and is a very difficult lifelong task.
